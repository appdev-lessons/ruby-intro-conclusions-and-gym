# Ruby Conclusions and Gym

Congratulations! You're ready to start writing some non-trivial Ruby programs.

## Think first, search second

Much of what we covered in the previous lessons is collected in [The One Ruby Reference](https://learn.firstdraft.com/lessons/33-the-one-ruby-reference). This is intended to be a quick reference of the classes and methods you have seen so far.

At this point we have all the **building blocks**:

  - **Expressions**: `object.method(argument) # => returns a value`
  - **Variables** to save the results of expressions.
  - **Conditionals** (If statements).
  - **Loops**.

That's all we _need_ to, technically, build anything — including all of the built-in methods.

### We are inventors 

When you signed up to learn how to program, you signed up to _become an inventor_.

Software **developers**, by definitions, tackle unsolved problems. There aren't predefined solutions to look up and apply. Otherwise, we'd just buy something off the shelf and be software **users**. (This is _much_ cheaper, if a solution to your problem already exists.)

When faced with a task, your first instinct should be: "How can I solve this puzzle with the tools I have?"

Your first instinct _shouldn't_ be: "Let me ask Google or ChatGPT for a solution to this problem." Developers do a lot of that, of course, but only after we've tried to solve it with what we already have.

"Google-Fu" is a hugely important skill to practice in software development, but in this course you should resist Googling. The answers you find are not suitable for beginners; they will more than likely slow you down. For example, many of those posts will use different syntax than we've seen up until now, and that will be confusing!

Any assigned task _will_ be achievable using the classes, methods, and keywords introduced in the previous Ruby lessons. Your job is to **invent** a combination of them that gets the job done using:

  - The previous Ruby lessons (e.g., `String`, `Array`, loops, etc.)

  - [The One Ruby Reference](https://learn.firstdraft.com/lessons/33-the-one-ruby-reference) for quick referencing and some additional methods that will be pointed out when needed.

## Ruby Gym

The next sequence of lessons is called the "Ruby Gym". You will launch each exercise from Canvas and complete the graded code blocks by passing all of the associated tests.

These are longer projects than the graded code block exercises we've seen so far, and they may require a few different tools to complete; so keep the lessons open for reference and scan through them for things that may help when you get stuck. All the tools are there.

There are likely a few ways to solve an exercise. Just get the code to pass all of the tests and you are good to move on. Remember, we are practicing being inventors; try to think before you search.

### Ruby Sandbox

As you are working on the exercise, you may find it easier to work through a solution using your `ruby-sandbox` Codespace. You can create a file for each puzzle in the Gym, which will give you more real estate to write your code, you can use `irb` or `debugger`, etc. When you think you've solved it, you can copy-paste your solution back into the graded code block here.

Using the `ruby-sandbox` is also a great way to save your solutions for safekeeping by Git committing and pushing. See the [`ruby-sandbox` lesson for more information](https://learn.firstdraft.com/lessons/80-ruby-intro-running-real-programs).

### Required Ruby Gym exercises

The required exercises, ordered in approximate order of difficulty (increasing). This is the order I recommend that you look at them in, but you can jump around if you're stuck and want to come back later.
